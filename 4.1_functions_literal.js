// Function Literals

function hey(){
	console.log("Good morning!");
}

//Four parts to a function literal
	//1: the word function
	//2: function name (which can be used to call itself recursively) - if no name, its anonymous
	//3: set of parameters in parenes - defined as variables in the function
	//4: set of statements wrapped in curly braces, body of the function to be executed
// can appear anywhere that an expression can
